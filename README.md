# Introduction
Button that will use a Raspberry Pi to turn on Philips Hue Lights

## Usage

I am using a Raspberry Pi 2, but you should be able to use almost any version of the Raspberry Pi without issue.

Make sure you have node.js and npm installed first, as these scripts require it. Also make sure you have python, but most Pi's come with it installed.

What I did was create a Projects folder under home pi: `cd /home/pi` then `mkdir Projects/` and `cd Projects/`

Clone the repo by using: `git clone https://github.com/cwalk/Hue-Button`

Feel free to get rid of the images, circuit diagrams, and README, as all the code is in the `HueButton/` folder and the launcher.sh script.



## Circuit

Here is the circuit diagram I used
